# NASA CMAPSS Predictive Maintenance ðŸš€

## Project Overview

This project implements **Predictive Maintenance using the NASA CMAPSS FD001 dataset** to predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of jet engines using **sensor data and Random Forest regression**.

It demonstrates a **data-driven approach to mechanical reliability**, combining **mechanical engineering knowledge and machine learning** for practical predictive maintenance applications.

---

## Dataset

- **NASA CMAPSS FD001 Dataset**: Simulated jet engine degradation under various operational conditions with 21 sensors and operational settings.
- Each row = One engine at one cycle with sensor readings.
- Goal: Predict **RUL (Remaining Useful Life)** for engines before failure.

Download the dataset:  
- [NASA CMAPSS Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ff5v-kuh6)
- Use the file: `train_FD001.txt`.

## Approach

âœ… Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
âœ… Computation of RUL for each cycle as the regression target  
âœ… Feature selection using sensor measurements  
âœ… Standardization for model stability  
âœ… Training a **Random Forest Regressor**  
âœ… Evaluation using RMSE and RÂ² metrics  
âœ… Visualization of predictions vs. actual RUL

---

## Results

- **RMSE:** ~41 cycles  
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.62

These results are consistent with a **clean baseline using Random Forest** on raw CMAPSS data.
